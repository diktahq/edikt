# edikt:upgrade

Upgrade edikt in this project to match the currently installed edikt version. Updates hooks, agent templates, and rule packs — never overwrites customizations without asking.

## Instructions

### 1. Check Prerequisites

Read `.edikt/config.yaml`. If not found:
```
No edikt config found. Run /edikt:init to set up this project.
```

Check that edikt templates exist at `~/.edikt/templates/`. If not:
```
edikt templates not found. Re-install edikt:
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diktahq/edikt/main/install.sh | bash
```

Use the Bash tool to read both versions — do NOT infer or guess them:
```bash
cat ~/.edikt/VERSION 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]'
grep '^edikt_version:' .edikt/config.yaml | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"'
```

Use the actual output of these commands as INSTALLED_VERSION and PROJECT_VERSION.

Show at the top of the output:
```
Installed edikt: {INSTALLED_VERSION}
Project edikt:   {PROJECT_VERSION}
```

If INSTALLED_VERSION == PROJECT_VERSION AND there are no changes detected in step 2 AND `edikt_version` is already set in `.edikt/config.yaml`, show:
```
✅ Already up to date (edikt {INSTALLED_VERSION}) — nothing to upgrade.
```
and stop.

If INSTALLED_VERSION != PROJECT_VERSION, always proceed with the upgrade — the version difference alone is reason enough.

If `edikt_version` is missing from `.edikt/config.yaml` (project predates versioning), always proceed — adding the version is itself an upgrade.

### 2. Detect What Needs Upgrading

Run all three checks in parallel and collect findings.

#### 2a. Hooks check

Read `.claude/settings.json`. Read `~/.edikt/templates/settings.json.tmpl`.

For each hook type, check two things: (1) is the content correct, and (2) is it using the modern `.sh` script reference format?

**Migration check — inline bash vs. script references:**
If any `type: command` hook has its logic inline (a long bash string) rather than referencing `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/*.sh`, it is outdated regardless of content. Note: "using inline bash — migrate to script reference".

**Content checks:**
- `SessionStart`: command should reference `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/session-start.sh` — if not → outdated
- `PreToolUse`: must be present with `Write|Edit` matcher — if missing → missing
- `PostToolUse`: must be present with `Write|Edit` matcher — if missing → missing
- `Stop`: must be type:command referencing `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/stop-hook.sh` — if type:prompt or inline → outdated
- `PreCompact`: command should reference `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/pre-compact.sh` — if not → outdated
- `UserPromptSubmit`: must be present — if missing → missing (v4: injects active plan phase)
- `PostCompact`: must be present — if missing → missing (v4: re-injects context after compaction)
- `SubagentStop`: must be present — if missing → missing (v4: logs agent activity + quality gates)
- `InstructionsLoaded`: must be present — if missing → missing (v4: logs rule pack loading)

For each outdated or missing hook, note what changed in plain English:
- "SessionStart: inline bash → migrate to `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/session-start.sh`"
- "PostToolUse: missing (auto-formats files after edits)"
- "UserPromptSubmit: missing (v4 — injects active plan phase into every prompt)"
- "PostCompact: missing (v4 — re-injects plan + invariants after compaction)"
- "SubagentStop: missing (v4 — logs agent activity, quality gates)"
- "InstructionsLoaded: missing (v4 — logs which rule packs load)"
- "Stop: outdated format (may cause JSON validation error) → migrate to `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/stop-hook.sh`"
- "PreCompact: inline bash → migrate to `$HOME/.edikt/hooks/pre-compact.sh`"

#### 2b. Agent check

List files in `.claude/agents/`. For each, check if a matching template exists in `~/.edikt/templates/agents/`.

**Skip customized agents.** An agent is customized if:
1. It contains `<!-- edikt:custom -->` anywhere in the file, OR
2. It is listed in `.edikt/config.yaml` under `agents.custom`

```yaml
# .edikt/config.yaml
agents:
  custom:
    - dba       # skip on upgrade — team has customized this agent
    - my-team-reviewer    # not from edikt templates
```

For each agent that is NOT customized and has a edikt template, compare content hashes — NOT modification times:
```bash
template_hash=$(md5 -q ~/.edikt/templates/agents/{slug}.md 2>/dev/null || md5sum ~/.edikt/templates/agents/{slug}.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')
installed_hash=$(md5 -q .claude/agents/{slug}.md 2>/dev/null || md5sum .claude/agents/{slug}.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')
```

- If customized → skip (note as "custom — skipped")
- If hashes differ → outdated
- If hashes match → up to date

Do NOT touch agents that have no matching template (user-created agents) or that are marked as custom.

#### 2c. Rule packs check

If `.claude/rules/` does not exist or contains no `.md` files → mark rule packs as "nothing installed, skip" (not outdated).

Otherwise, same logic as `/edikt:rules-update`:
- Compare `version:` frontmatter in installed vs template
- Only flag as outdated if installed version < template version
- Skip files without `<!-- edikt:generated -->` marker (manually edited)
- Skip files not in the registry (custom rules)

### 3. Show Upgrade Summary

Show what will change in this project before touching anything:

```
EDIKT UPGRADE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hooks (.claude/settings.json)
  ⬆  SessionStart   — inline bash → script reference
  ⬆  PostToolUse    — missing, will add auto-format hook
  ⬆  Stop           — fix "Prompt hook condition was not met" error (ok:false → ok:true always)
  ⬆  PreCompact     — inline bash → script reference

Agents (.claude/agents/)
  ⬆  dba.md   — template updated
  ⬆  security.md  — template updated
  ✓  architect.md  — up to date

Rule packs (.claude/rules/)
  ⬆  go.md          1.0 → 1.2
  ⬆  code-quality.md 1.0 → 1.1
  ✓  testing.md      — up to date
  —  my-custom.md    — custom, skipped
  —  security.md     — manually edited, skipped

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4 hook changes, 2 agents, 2 rule packs
```

If no rule packs are installed (`.claude/rules/` is missing or empty), show:
```
Rule packs (.claude/rules/)
  —  no rule packs installed
```
Do NOT show any `⬆` icon for rules in this case.

If everything is already up to date:
```
✅ Already up to date — nothing to upgrade.
```

### 4. Confirm

Ask the user:
```
Apply these upgrades? (y/n/select)
  y      — apply all
  n      — cancel
  select — choose which sections to apply (hooks / agents / rules)
```

Wait for response. If `select`, ask separately for each section.

If cancelled:
```
Upgrade cancelled — no changes made.
```

### 5. Apply Upgrades

#### Hooks

Read the current `.claude/settings.json`. Read the template.

For each outdated hook, replace ONLY that hook's entry — do not touch other hooks or non-hook settings (like `permissions`). Merge carefully:

```python
# Pseudocode
settings = read_json('.claude/settings.json')
template_hooks = read_json('~/.edikt/templates/settings.json.tmpl')['hooks']

for hook_type in ['SessionStart', 'PreToolUse', 'PostToolUse', 'Stop', 'PreCompact']:
    if hook_type needs upgrade:
        settings['hooks'][hook_type] = template_hooks[hook_type]

write_json('.claude/settings.json', settings)
```

**Never remove** hooks that exist in `settings.json` but not in the template (the user may have added their own).

#### Agents

For each outdated agent:
1. Read the installed file
2. Read the template
3. Replace the installed file with the template content

Skip agents without a matching template. Skip user-created agents (no matching template slug).

#### Rule packs

Same as `/edikt:rules-update` logic — replace outdated packs, skip manually edited and custom ones.

### 6. Post-Upgrade

After applying:

1. Always update `edikt_version` in `.edikt/config.yaml` to the installed version — even if no other changes were applied:
   - If a `edikt_version:` line exists, replace it
   - If it doesn't exist (project predates versioning), add it as the first non-comment line after any leading `#` comment block at the top of the file

2. Check if linter configs exist and linter rules are outdated (template mtime > linter rule mtime):
   ```
   Linter configs found. Run /edikt:sync to regenerate linter rules.
   ```

3. Output results:

If only `edikt_version` was added (everything else was already current):
```
