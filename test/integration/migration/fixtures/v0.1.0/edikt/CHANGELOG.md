# edikt changelog

## v0.1.0 (2026-03-23)

### First public release

edikt governs your architecture and compiles your engineering decisions into automatic enforcement. It governs the Agentic SDLC from requirements to verification — closing the gap between what you decided and what gets built.

**Architecture governance & compliance**
- `/edikt:compile` reads accepted ADRs, active invariants, and team guidelines, checks for contradictions, and produces `.claude/rules/governance.md` — directives Claude follows automatically every session
- 20 rule packs (10 base, 4 lang, 6 framework) — correctness guardrails, not opinions. 14-17 instructions per pack (research-validated sweet spot)
- Domain-specific governance checkpoints with pre-action and post-result verification
- Signal detection: stop hook detects architecture decisions mid-session, suggests ADR capture
- Quality gates: configure agents as gates in `.edikt/config.yaml`. Critical findings block progression with logged override
- Pre-push invariant check: violations block the push. Override with `EDIKT_INVARIANT_SKIP=1`

**Agentic SDLC governance**
- Full traceability chain: `/edikt:prd` → `/edikt:spec` → `/edikt:spec-artifacts` → `/edikt:plan` → execute → `/edikt:drift`
- Status-gated transitions: PRD must be accepted before spec, spec before artifacts
- `/edikt:drift` compares implementation against the full chain with confidence-based severity
- CI support: `--output=json` with exit code 1 on diverged findings

**18 specialist agents**
- architect, api, backend, dba, docs, frontend, performance, platform, pm, qa, security, sre, ux, data, mobile, compliance, seo, gtm
- Used in spec review, plan pre-flight, post-implementation review, and audit

**9 lifecycle hooks**
- SessionStart: git-aware briefing with domain classification
- UserPromptSubmit: injects active plan phase into every prompt
- PostToolUse: auto-formats files after edits
- PostCompact: re-injects plan + invariants after context compaction
- Stop: regex-based signal detection for decisions, doc gaps, security
- SubagentStop: logs agent activity, enforces quality gates
- InstructionsLoaded: logs active rule packs
- PreToolUse: validates governance setup
- PreCompact: preserves plan state

**24 commands**
- Governance chain: `init`, `prd`, `spec`, `spec-artifacts`, `plan`, `drift`, `compile`
- Decisions: `adr`, `invariant`
- Review: `review`, `audit`, `review-governance`, `doctor`
- Observability: `status`, `session`, `docs`
- Setup: `context`, `intake`, `upgrade`, `rules-update`, `sync`, `team`, `mcp`, `agents`

**Research**
- 123 eval runs across 2 experiments proving rule compliance mechanism
- EXP-001: 15/15 compliance with rules vs 0/15 without on invented conventions
- EXP-002: holds under multi-rule conflict, multi-file sessions, Opus vs Sonnet, adversarial prompts
- Reproducible: `experiments/exp-001-rule-compliance/` and `experiments/exp-002-extended-compliance/`

**Website**
- Full documentation at edikt.dev
- Guides: solo engineer, teams, multi-project, greenfield, brownfield, monorepo, security, daily workflow
- Governance section: chain, gates, compile, drift, review-governance

**Zero dependencies**
- Every file is `.md` or `.yaml` — no build step, no runtime, no daemon
- `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diktahq/edikt/main/install.sh | bash`
- Claude Code only — uses platform primitives (path-conditional rules, lifecycle hooks, slash commands, specialist agents, quality gates)
