# edikt:spec-artifacts

Generate implementable artifacts (data model, API contracts, migrations, test strategy) from an accepted technical specification. Each artifact is reviewed by the appropriate domain specialist.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — SPEC identifier (e.g., `SPEC-005`) or path to the spec folder

## Instructions

### 1. Resolve Paths

Read `.edikt/config.yaml`. Specs directory from `specs: { dir: }` (default: `docs/product/specs/`).

### 2. Find and Validate the Spec

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a SPEC identifier (e.g., `SPEC-005`):
```bash
find {specs_dir}/ -name "SPEC-005*" -type d
```

Read `{spec_folder}/spec.md`. Check the frontmatter `status:` field:
- If `status: accepted` → proceed
- If `status: draft` → block:
  ```
  ⛔ SPEC-005 status is "draft".
     Specs must be accepted before generating artifacts.
     Review the spec and change status to "accepted" first.
  ```
- If no frontmatter status → treat as accepted (backwards compatibility)

### 3. Detect Relevant Artifacts

Scan the spec content for artifact triggers. Show the user what will be generated:

```
Based on SPEC-005, these artifacts are relevant:
```

Apply these detection rules:

| If the spec mentions... | Artifact | Primary agent | Secondary |
|---|---|---|---|
| database, model, schema, entity, table, column, field, relationship | `data-model.md` | dba | architect |
| API, endpoint, route, REST, GraphQL, request, response, contract | `contracts/api.md` | api | architect |
| gRPC, protobuf, proto, service definition | `contracts/proto/` | api | engineer |
| migration, schema change, ALTER, CREATE TABLE | `migrations.md` | dba | sre |
| event, message, queue, Kafka, RabbitMQ, pub/sub, webhook delivery | `contracts/events.md` | architect | sre |
| test, testing strategy, coverage, unit test, integration test | `test-strategy.md` | qa | engineer |
| config, environment variable, feature flag, configuration | `config-spec.md` | sre | engineer |
| seed, fixture, test data, sample data, development data (also auto-triggers when data-model.md is generated) | `fixtures.md` | qa | dba |

Show the list with checkmarks:
```
  ✓ data-model.md — schema mentions detected
  ✓ contracts/api.md — API endpoint references
  ✓ test-strategy.md — testing strategy section
  ✗ migrations.md — no schema changes
  ✗ contracts/events.md — no messaging patterns
  ✗ config-spec.md — no config changes

Generate 3 artifacts? (y/n)
```

Wait for confirmation.

### 4. Generate Artifacts

For each confirmed artifact, route to the primary + secondary agent via the Agent tool.

Each agent receives:
- The spec content
- The source PRD content (read from `source_prd:` in spec frontmatter)
- The project-context.md for project context
- Any referenced ADRs
- Instruction to produce the specific artifact type

Show routing as it happens:
```
🪝 edikt: routing data-model.md to dba...
🪝 edikt: routing contracts/api.md to api...
🪝 edikt: routing test-strategy.md to qa...
```

### 5. Artifact Templates

Each artifact gets frontmatter and lives in the spec's folder:

**data-model.md:**
```markdown

status: draft

# Fixtures & Seed Data — {feature name}

## Purpose

{What this seed data enables: development environment, integration tests, demo, or all}

## Seed Scenarios

### Scenario: {name} — {what it tests or enables}

| Entity | Key fields | Why this data matters |
|---|---|---|
| {Entity} | {field: value, field: value} | {what behavior this enables or edge case it covers} |

### Scenario: {name}

| Entity | Key fields | Why this data matters |
|---|---|---|
| {Entity} | {field: value} | {reason} |

## Relationships

{How seed entities relate to each other. Order of creation matters for foreign keys.}

## Edge Cases

{Seed data specifically designed to cover edge cases:
- Expired subscriptions for renewal testing
- Users with no permissions for auth boundary testing
- Empty collections for nil-handling
- Maximum-length strings for validation testing}

## Implementation Notes

{Database-agnostic. During implementation, generate the appropriate format
for the project's stack: SQL seeds, factory definitions, JSON fixtures,
Prisma seed.ts, etc. The data model artifact defines the schema — this
artifact defines what data to populate and why.}
```

REMEMBER: Every artifact must be reviewed by the appropriate specialist agent. NEVER generate an artifact without routing it to the agent listed in the detection table. The spec must be accepted before artifacts are generated.

### 6. Confirm
