# /edikt:status

Your project dashboard. Where are we, what's in progress, what's next.

## You probably won't type this

Just ask:

> "what's our status?"
> "where are we?"
> "what's next?"

Claude runs `/edikt:status` automatically.

## What it shows

The dashboard has six sections:

**Governance health** — rules installed, agents, decisions, compiled directives status, active plan phase.

**Active spec** — if a spec is in progress: its status, artifact acceptance counts, and the last drift report summary.

**Chain status** — the full governance chain for the active spec, e.g. `PRD-005 accepted → SPEC-005 accepted → artifacts 3/3 accepted → PLAN-007 in progress`.

**Gate activity** — any quality gate firings from the current session, including what was found and whether it was resolved or overridden.

**Agent activity** — specialist agents that ran this session, how many times, and in what context (plan pre-flight, review, audit).

**Hook activity** — hook fires by type this session (rule loads, agent invocations, signals detected).

**Signals detected** — ADR candidates, doc gaps, and security signals surfaced by the Stop hook during the session.

**WHAT'S NEXT** is the most important part — it tells you the concrete next tasks, not just a phase name.

## Persisted to disk

After displaying the dashboard, `/edikt:status` writes the same output to `docs/STATUS.md`. Commit it so your team can see project health without running the command. edikt uses sentinel markers so re-runs only update the edikt block — any notes you add above it are preserved.

## No active plan?

If there's no plan in progress, `/edikt:status` still shows your installed rules and governance health, and suggests running `/edikt:sdlc:plan` to start one.

## Natural language triggers

- "what's our status?"
- "where are we?"
- "what's next?"
- "what should we work on?"
- "project status"
