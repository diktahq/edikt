# INV-001 — Commands are plain markdown, no compiled code

**Status:** Active

## Rule

Every edikt command is a `.md` file. No TypeScript, no compiled binaries, no build step. The system must work by copying files into `~/.claude/commands/`.

## Why

- Zero installation friction — copy files, done
- Claude reads markdown natively — no wrapper needed
- Contributors can read and edit commands without a dev environment
- Survives Claude Code API changes — worst case, edit the markdown

## Enforcement

- No `package.json`, `go.mod`, or build files at the root
- All commands live in `commands/` as `.md` files
- Templates are plain `.md` files in `templates/`
